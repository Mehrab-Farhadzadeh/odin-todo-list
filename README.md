# Odin Todo List

## Goals

- Practice all the studied and practiced material on code organization: objects, modules, classes, ES6 modules, webpack, OOP principles. And on transferring data: JSON.

## Not to Do

- This is a capstone project, I'm not sure if there's any thing that I should avoid. Maybe just before it touches the boundaries of being a portfolio work.

## To Do

- Integrate add and edit form
- Improve UI and UX
